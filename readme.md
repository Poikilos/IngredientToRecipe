# IngredientToRecipe
When you find an item in Dragon Quest VIII, *minor mid-game spoiler* you can immediately know which items you can make in the Alchemy Pot.

Requirements:
- Download the guide(s) in the "requirements" directory to the "bin" folder (or same folder where you save IngredientToRecipe.exe.

My guide lists every ingredient (simple item, not advanced item) alphabetically, so that is how it is very different. Instead of looking up the item you want to make, you looking whatever random thing you got in a chest (or anywhere) and find out what you can make with it! Every ingredient is listed, not just the first ingredient. For example, if a recipe has 3 ingredients, the whole recipe is listed 3 times so you can look up each ingredient and still find the recipe by any one of the 3 item names! It helped me enjoy the game more by helping me get advanced items sooner so I could spend slightly less time grinding for EXP and gold.

You don't need to compile this old program that requires my older dependency. You can just download a release PDF:
- [Releases](https://github.com/Poikilos/IngredientToRecipe/releases).

This is a guide I made using some programming: I reversed AIex's guide and generated an HTML file. The program detected the recipes and ingredients, and I even made fixes to the guide. AIex, I hope you will approve and explain how to credit you or what things shouldn't be included in the repository or release. I hope you and others enjoy this guide, and I hope it helps you enjoy the game more.
