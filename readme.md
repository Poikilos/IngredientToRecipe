# IngredientToRecipe
When you find an item in Dragon Quest VIII, *minor mid-game spoiler* you can immediately know which items you can make in the Alchemy Pot.

Details and other formats will appear here:

The code and exe file(s) at this repository are only for development purposes. To get the guide and use it, see the link above instead, since:

There is no permission to redistribute AIex guide and AIex has declared to not respond to anyone's inquiries therefore I can't fix and distribute my patched copy of AIex guide with errors fixed so to get the fixes you must instead download my guide (making the exe useless to anyone but me since all it does is produce my guide).
